						<h3 class="content-titles">George Milton</h3>
						<p>George Milton is one of the main characters of the novel and is described as being "small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features" as well as having "small, strong hands, slender arms, [and] a thin and bony nose" (Steinbeck 2). While he isn't necessarily the nicest friend to his large companion Lennie, George desires the company that Lennie brings him. This is seen when George goes off on a rant on pages 11-12 about how much better off he would be without Lennie by his side, only to double back on what he said on page 13 and comfort Lennie, saying he "was jus' foolin." It is through Lennie that George is able to see their grand dream and believe that it may be possible. On his own, he would have scolded himself for thinking of such an impossible prospect, but, with Lennie, he can believe that it could actually be possible. George's character is very much defined through his interactions with Lennie, who indirectly shows George's compassionate side. George's ending is perhaps the most tragic of all in the novel. As a result of Lennie's death, he has become one of the lonely ranchhands that he described in chapter 1, the kind of men who "got no family. They don't belong no place" (Steinbeck 13). Because of Lennie's death, George is just like all of the other lost souls of the Great Depression. He is now nothing more than another homeless man aimlessly traveling from farm to farm in search of menial work. When George lost Lennie, he lost what he had to live for.</p>

						<h3 class="content-titles">Lennie Small</h3>
						<p>Lennie Small is a very large man with an obvious mental impairment. His size and his close friend George are about all he has going for him. His relationship with George is not one of equals, however. It is more similar to a father-son relationship, with Lennie being the relatively unintelligent child that his father (George) must look after. His childlike behaviours arise from the previously mentioned mental disability. He struggles to remember anything; he is constantly focused on owning something soft like the rabbits; and he is incredibly concerned with making George happy. In his quest for George's pleasing, he even gives away all of the imaginary ketchup that he openly dreams about in the first chapter, saying he "wouldn't eat none... [he would] leave it all for [George]... [he] could cover [his] beans with it and [Lennie] wouldn't touch none of it" (Steinbeck 12). Lennie's childish mannerisms also result in him always being described as talking "happily" since he is unable to discern what is a serious situation and what is not. In the end, Lennie succumbs to his being too powerful for his own good.</p>

						<h3 class="content-titles">Candy</h3>
						<p>Candy is an old ranch worker who lost one of his hands in a farm accident long ago and subsequently has to work as a swamper, excluded from the rest of the group because of his disability. Candy's dog was once a master sheepherder, but has now become old and worn and is kicked to the side now that it has lost its use. Candy now lives in fear of the day when his usefulness is spent and he is kicked to the curb much like his dog. For Candy, however, things are even worse, as he is emotionally wrecked by the situation. He is unable to bring himself to put the dog out of its misery, and it is this fear that holds him back from making anything more of his life. When his dog is killed, he loses everything left that he had to live for. As a new way out, Candy tries to wiggle his way into George and Lennie's dream. Even though it is his final option, Candy still finds a way to remind George and Lennie of the likelihood of the plan's failure. You could argue that Candy is an embodiment of the despair of reaching the end of a long and tiresome life that got you no closer to the fabled American Dream. </p>
