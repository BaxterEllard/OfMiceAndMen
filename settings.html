					<h3 class="content-titles">Salinas River</h3>
					<p>A riverbank on the beautiful Salinas River only a few miles from the ranch is where the story both ends and begins. It is on this riverbank where the reader is introduced to the novel's protagonists, George Milton and Lennie Small. It is also the place where George and Lennie's dream are first introduced. The riverbank is where George tells Lennie to go should he get into trouble, only for it to end up ironically being the place where Lennie is killed by George. Initially, the river represents hope for the future and the American Dream, but when we return to it at the end of the story, it represents the death of that dream as George mercifully kills Lennie in the same spot where they slept only days before. </p>

					<h3 class="content-titles">The Bunk House</h3>
					<p>The bunk house is where George, Lennie, Candy, and the rest of the workers (except Crooks) live. In the house, the men make an attempt at bonding with each other and building a home life of sorts. It also goes to serve as a symbol of elite masculinity, with outsiders such as Curley's wife and Crooks frequently being prevented from entry.</p>

					<h3 class="content-titles">The Barn/Crooks' Room</h3>
					<p>Crooks lives an aggrieved and isolated life alone in the barn. The barn itself is described as a dark and foreboding place in the story, and is the place in which a crucial conversation between Crooks and Lennie occurs that shows the reader how much of an impact exclusion and loneliness can have on someone. Crooks being forced to live alone in the barn with the other animals also reinforces the view of African-Americans as subhuman that, sadly, was shared by many at the time. It is also the place where Lennie seals his fate when he kills Curley's wife.</p>
