					<p>Companionship is a theme that is repeatedly stressed throughout the story. Through this theme of companionship, Steinbeck is trying to show just how hard it was for those that were alone during the Great Depression. It starts with the introduction of the father-son relationship that George and Lennie have. At first, it seems fairly normal to the reader. When they arrive at the ranch, however, we see just how unique their relationship is in the sense that it exists in the first place. It seems as if companionsip between people, especially between two working men, is so rare in the Great Depression that it prompts Curley to question if the two are gay. When the companionship between Candy and his dog are introduced, we see that even companionship has an extremely depressing side to it. Still, the companionship that George shares with Lennie and that Candy shares with his dog is what keeps them going. It gives them something to live for, and, without it, they are left to roam aimlessly in an uncaring world.</p>

					<h3 class="content-titles">Isolation</h3>
					<p>Loneliness is very present throughout the book. At the top level, there are the depressing lives of the ranch workers who go into town on Saturday night to drown their loneliness in alcohol and women. Similarly, the lonely outsiders of the ranch are left to wander about each other looking for someone to talk to, as shown when everyone ends up in Crooks' room looking for someone to talk to. The exclusion felt by many characters is key in shaping who they are in the story. For example, Curley's wife's disconnection from other people and her subsequent desire for even the simplest human interaction fuels her attention-seeking tendencies that are then misinterpreted by the people she tries to connect with as her being just another tart. George and Lennie's relationship and their dream of the farm are efforts at breaking this pattern of loneliness, but the ultimate end of their relationship represents what everyone becomes in the end: alone.</p>

					<h3 class="content-titles">The Dream</h3>
					<p>In a sense, Of Mice and Men is a story about the nature of human dreams and aspirations and natural odds against them. The novel demonstrates how we give meaning to our lives through the creation of grand dreams for us to pursue. Without them, life is nothing more than a meaningless period of time. George and Lennie's dream is something they cling onto so dearly that it has almost become a ritual between the two men for George to recite it and for Lennie to get very excited. For Lennie, it represents the sense of security he gets from petting soft things, somewhere where he does not have to be afraid. For Crooks, the farm is a place where he can finally attain the self-respect that he so desperately wishes for. For Candy, it is his final escape and a place where he can assert the responsibility that he should have asserted when he could not kill his dog. For George, the dream represents independence and having a place in the world. To him, the thing threatening the dream most is Lennie. Ironically, it is also the only thing that makes the dream worthwhile.</p>
