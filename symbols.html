					<h3 class="content-titles">Candy's Dog</h3>
					<p>Candy's dog continues the theme of companionship, but also symbolises the fate of those who outlive their usefulness. It represents those who are seen as weak by society, and how they are cast aside because of that. The dog was once a great sheepdog, but now it has been crippled with age. The killing of Candy's dog spreads a clear message throughout the farm: anything that is more trouble than it's worth cannot be allowed to exist. This ends up foreshadowing Lennie's merciful death, as he was killed for his own good. It also foreshadows how one day Candy will be tossed aside much like his dog, and that is a fate that Candy fears greatly.</p>

					<h3 class="content-titles">Mice</h3>
					<p>The mice, and other soft things like it, are a symbol of false hope, mostly applying to Lennie. This appears several times throughout the novel, first showing up in a dead mouse that Lennie keeps in his pocket to pet. This is part of Lennie's desire to pet and keep soft things, a desire that is plagued by his unfortunate talent for killing the things he loves. Similarly to the men of the story, the mice are victims of a cruel fate.</p>

					<h3 class="content-titles">Hands</h3>
					<p>Hands are used symbolically many times in the book. To start, the men on the ranch are referred to as "hands," suggesting that each of them must do their job to make the ranch work as a whole. This effectively dehumanises the men and takes away their unique personalities, essentially labeling them as nothing but workers, not men. Candy's missing hand represents his helplessness to time and his growing old as well as his fear that he will be cast aside when his usefullness is all used up like his dog. Lennie's large and powerful hands symbolise trouble because trouble seems to follow their use. George's hands are small and strong, much like him. They represent his cunning characteristics. Curley's hands are cruel and one is crushed by the dangerous Lennie Machine; the hand that he keeps soft for his wife is a symbol of Curley's helplessness and inability to take any effective action, as well as an inability to satisfy his wife. Curley's wife's hands have red nails. Slim's hands are large and skillfull. Crooks' hands are pink. Steinbeck uses the hands of each character to represent their intrinsic nature.</p>
